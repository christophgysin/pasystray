PulseAudio system tray - A replacement for the deprecated padevchooser.

Pasystray allows setting the default PulseAudio source/sink and moving
streams on the fly between sources/sinks without restarting the client
application. It does not (yet) support setting X properties.

Scrolling over the status icon adjusts the default sink volume, holding down
Ctrl key while scrolling adjusts the default source. Scrolling also works on
menu items for sources, sinks, input and output streams.
Middle-clicking on the status icon toggles muting the default sink (default
source if holding Ctrl-key). Middle clicking on menu entries toggles muting
the selected device/stream.
Devices can be renamed by right-clicking on the respective menu entry (needs
module-device-manager to be loaded).

To detect remote sinks/sources you need to enable module-zeroconf-discover on
the local PulseAudio instance and module-zeroconf-publish on the remote side.
Pasystray does not (yet) browse the network for available PulseAudio servers.

To control a different server than the local instance, run pasystray as:

$ PULSE_SERVER=remote_host pasystray

If pasystray icon is not displayed in your Unity system tray, you will have
to whitelist it. Read this for instructions:
